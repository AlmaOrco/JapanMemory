# JapanMemory
A cultural game project for a school celebration

## Synopsis
Classic memory game with pictures of anime characters. Developed with CodeIgniter. It returns JSON objects to get information about cards and players from MySQL. Then, the js script can work and deploy the game.

## Motivation
This was a teamwork for a cultural week. We had to develop a web game related with japanesse culture, and we decided to make a **memory**, just as [VirostaRH](https://github.com/VirostaRH) proposed.
